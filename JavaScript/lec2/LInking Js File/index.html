    html file before the body tag so that the js file is loaded before the html
    file is loaded

    <!--Page loads quickly – Since HTML and CSS load first, the user can see the page immediately.

Reduces loading time – If the script is written inside <head>, the page will pause until the script loads.

Improves website performance – The page loads first, and then the script runs, making the webpage smoother.
