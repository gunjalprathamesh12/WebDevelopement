Alpha channel:- 
               alpha channel sets opacity for colors 
               it tanges from  0 to 1.

               .box {
    background-color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 0.5); /* Red color with 50% opacity */
                    } 

opacity:- 
               opacity is same like alpha channel but it sets opacity of the element.
               it ranges from 0 to 1.

Transitions:-  
              animations between the elements
