Box Model in css:-
                  Everything in CSS has a box around it, and understanding these boxes is key to being able to create more complex layouts with CSS, or to align items with other items.

1 Height & width:-
                  In the CSS box model, the height and width attributes are used to set the height and width of an element's content area. Here's a simple explanation:

                  width: Sets the width of the content area of an element.
                  height: Sets the height of the content area of an element

2 Border        :-
                  The border attribute in CSS is used to define the border around an element. It consists of three main properties:

                  border-width: Specifies the thickness of the border.
                  border-style: Specifies the style of the border (e.g., solid, dashed, dotted).
                  border-color: Specifies the color of the border.

                  we can use above three atrributes in a single line called as Border ShortHand
