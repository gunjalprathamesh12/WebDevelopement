Here are short, simple, and precise notes on each topic you studied today, written for quick revision and clear understanding.

1. Inline, Internal, External CSS

Inline CSS: Written inside HTML tag using style attribute. Highest priority.

Internal CSS: Written inside <style> tag in <head>.

External CSS: Written in a separate .css file. Best for large projects.

2. Element Selector in CSS

Selects HTML elements by tag name.

Example:

p {
  color: blue;
}


Applies to all <p> elements.

3. Class Selector in CSS

Selects elements with a specific class.

Uses . (dot).

Example:

.box {
  border: 1px solid black;
}


Can be used on multiple elements.

4. ID Selector in CSS

Selects one unique element.

Uses #.

Example:

#header {
  background: red;
}


ID should be unique in a page.

5. Attribute Selector in CSS

Selects elements based on attributes.

Example:

input[type="text"] {
  color: green;
}


Useful for forms and inputs.

6. Descendant Selector in CSS

Selects elements inside another element.

Uses space.

Example:

div p {
  color: red;
}


Selects all <p> inside <div>.

7. Sibling Selectors in CSS

Select elements at the same level.

Adjacent sibling (+): selects immediate next element.

General sibling (~): selects all next siblings.

Example:

h1 + p {
  color: blue;
}

8. Universal Selector in CSS

Selects all elements.

Uses *.

Example:

* {
  margin: 0;
}


Often used for CSS reset.

9. Pseudo-element

Styles specific parts of an element.

Uses ::.

Example:

p::first-letter {
  font-size: 30px;
}


Common ones: ::before, ::after, ::first-line.

10. !important in CSS

Overrides all other CSS rules.

Example:

color: red !important;


Should be avoided unless absolutely needed.

11. Inheritance in CSS

Child elements get some styles from parent automatically.

Inherited: color, font-family, font-size

Not inherited: margin, padding, border

Reduces repeated code.

12. Try1, Try2, Try3 (Practice Folders)

Used for hands-on practice.

Helps understand CSS behavior through testing.

Best way to learn CSS is trial + error.

One-line revision tip 🧠

Selectors decide what to style, properties decide how to style, and priority decides which style wins.
