    /* CSS Box Model: Every HTML element is treated as a rectangular box. The
    box model consists of: 1) Content – The actual text or image inside the
    element. 2) Padding – Space between content and border. 3) Border – The
    outline around padding and content. 4) Margin – Space outside the border
    (distance from other elements). Total width = content width + padding +
    border + margin Total height = content height + padding + border + margin By
    default, width and height apply only to the content. If we use: box-sizing:
    border-box; then padding and border are included inside the given width and
    height. The box model helps control spacing and layout of elements properly.

      Now is the winter of our discontent Made glorious summer by this sun of
      York; And all the clouds that lour'd upon our house In the deep bosom of
      the ocean buried. Now are our brows bound with victorious wreaths; Our
      bruised arms hung up for monuments; Our stern alarums changed to merry
      meetings, Our dreadful marches to delightful measures. Grim-visaged war
      hath smooth'd his wrinkled front;

      And now, instead of mounting barded steeds To fright the souls of fearful
      adversaries, He capers nimbly in a lady's chamber To the lascivious
      pleasing of a lute. But I, that am not shaped for sportive tricks, Nor
      made to court an amorous looking-glass; I, that am rudely stamp'd, and
      want love's majesty To strut before a wanton ambling nymph; I, that am
      curtail'd of this fair proportion,
